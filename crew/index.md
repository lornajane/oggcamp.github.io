<img src="/assets/img/CrewThankYou.jpg" class="right-float-crew" /> OggCamp like any other community event relies on the great work of volunteers who help keep everything running. We aim to make being part of the crew a positive experience for all involved. You get to give something back but also enjoy the event and not be overloaded.

**We really need crew members who can:**

- Meet, greet and register delegates
- Alert the organising team to any Code of Conduct violations
- Run the famous merchandise stall
- Ensure that talks / workshops keep on time
- Announce the next talks
- Carry and move kit

**But what do you get for this?**
In return for volunteering you will receive a limited edition crew t-shirt, free standard event t-shirt and mug to remember us by. Plus of course the enternal gratitude of all the organisers which doesn't have a cash value but will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside :-)

If this sounds good please sign up using this form, thank you!
