While you don't *have* to have a ticket to come to OggCamp, registering helps us know how many people to expect and provide you with a better experience.

* Tickets are available on a "pay what you want" basis which includes *nothing*. You can put 0 in the amount box.
* If you would like to make a payment to help cover costs (we are a non-profit event) it's easy to do that too.

This year we are tying out a new ticketing system. <a href="https://ti.to/oggcamp/oggcamp-2019" target="_blank">See full listing on the Ti.to site.</a>

All attendees are required to agree and comply with the [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}/code-of-conduct).

Please note that the talk rooms are various sizes and may not be able to fit all attendees.  All sessions are first-come-first-served, so if you want to make sure you get a seat for a particular talk, get there early!

<!-- You can also add yourself to the <a href="https://joind.in/event/oggcamp-18-2018">Joind.in page for OggCamp '18</a>. It's a great way to see who else is coming, what talks are planned, and also provide feedback on both the event and the talks you've attended. -->
