title: Sponsor OggCamp
---
Although we keep OggCamp free to attend it does cost a considerable amount of money to put on. Each year we pay for venue hire, technical equipment, food, transport, stationary and a whole host of other random things. In order to do that we rely on the support of some wonderful sponsors.

If you or your company would like to sponsor the event please download our PDF sponsor pack which contains all the details you need.

We look forward to hearing from you! :-)
