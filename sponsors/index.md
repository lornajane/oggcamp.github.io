title: Sponsor OggCamp
---
We have vowed to ensure that entry to OggCamp will never depend on attendees ability to pay. Tickets are free, though many choose to donate and we appreciate that. It costs a cosinderable amount of money to put on OggCamp. Each year we pay for venue hire, technical equipment, food, transport, stationary and a whole host of other things.

In order to make the event happen and keep it all running we rely on the support of some wonderful sponsors.

If you or your company are thinking of sponsoring the event please download our PDF sponsor pack which contains all the details you need.

We look forward to hearing from you! :-)
