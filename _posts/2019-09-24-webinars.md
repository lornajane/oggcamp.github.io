OggCamp is a month away and we can't wait! No really, we literally couldn't wait that long to talk to everyone so we've scheduled some [Warmup Webinars](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/oggcamp-warmup--webinars) to prepare for the event. We did some detailed research on the topic as you can see here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;re planning to attend <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/oggcamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#oggcamp</a> this year, would you find a webinar beforehand helpful? Topic ideas so far</p>&mdash; Lorna Mitchell (@lornajane) <a href="https://twitter.com/lornajane/status/1169279994771771397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The first webinar is on Friday 27th September at 8pm UK time and will introduce you to how the OggCamp scheduling works. We'll run through how to find out what talks are going on, how to suggest a talk, how your suggestions get scheduled, and how to request a talk topic when you can't give the talk yourself. There are also lightning talks so we'll chat about that too!

There is another webinar on 2nd October at 8pm UK time and this second session is about preparing to give a talk, even if you only have a little bit of time available. Hopefully it will give you an idea of how you could give a talk of your own - at any event, not just OggCamp!

Both webinars are hosted by our content curator Lorna Mitchell, herself an experienced conference speaker and event organiser. The webinars are interactive, there are ways to ask questions and interact with Lorna and the other attendees, and if you can't make the sessions in real time then there will be recordings afterwards.

Sound good? [Sign up here](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/oggcamp-warmup--webinars) and we'll see you online soon!
