This year our OggCamp venue is at the [Manchester Conference Centre](https://www.pendulumhotel.co.uk/) which has a hotel on site: Pendulum Hotel.

If you want to stay on site, we have a block of rooms reserved, but they can only be booked by telephone. The prices for this discounted block are:

* Friday 18th October: £89
* Saturday 19th October: £119
* Sunday 20th October: £89

**To book: phone 0161 955 8062 and quote code GA01775**

Since we're in central Manchester this year, there are PLENTY of other options nearby and by easy transport connection. Particularly look out for the Ibis next door, the reasonably priced MotelOne and plenty of other more and less expensive options. The nearest train and tram stations are both at Manchester Picadilly.

If you need recommendations or local knowledge, try asking on our [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAAsF-xo4ol9jAjNW8A) or [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/oggcamp).

We are hearing that hotels are booking up fast due to other events on the same weekend, so do please make your arrangements when you can!
