OggCamp is an unconference, but we do like to pin down some likely characters for one scheduled track - it gives you some idea of what you can expect and still leaves two tracks open to fill on the day. This year, we're opening the bidding with:

* An update on the state of MQTT, a fun and fantastic technology that was born at OggCamp
* A beginners perspective on Ubuntu
* An introduction to IndieWeb and owning your own platforms/content
* A selection of fun and geeky side projects

Remember that it's an unconference so there will be much more schedule appearing during the weekend itself, but until then you can check out [speakers page](/speakers) for more details of the scheduled track.
